# My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website showcases my skills, projects, certifications, and more. I built this portfolio to demonstrate my experience and passion for software development. Feel free to explore and learn more about me and my work.

## Note
I deployed the project without 3D models, motions, and visuals for now. To explore and check the 3D models and their visuals, you can view the code commented in the files on my GitHub.
I have commented out certain sections related to the 3D models and animations temporarily, as they are still under development and may cause performance issues after deployment.

## About Me

I am a passionate software developer with a strong background in web development, particularly in React, Node.js, and other modern technologies. I am continuously learning and seeking new opportunities to grow and contribute to meaningful projects.

Feel free to reach out to me if youâ€™d like to collaborate or if you have any questions!
Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
